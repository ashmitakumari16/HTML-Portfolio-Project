   <hr/>
   <h3>Shersha</h3>
   <p> The songs in movie are just so mesmerising. Loved the couple in the movie, they look so perfect together. Last but not the least got to know about one of the bravest solder of our nation Major Vikram Batra. Huge respect for him from bottom of my heart. </p>
   <h3>Sir</h3>
   <p> The movie is just amazing and very motivating. Highly recommendated movie for students of any age group.</p>
   <h3>Real Tewar</h3>
   <p> This is a south indian movie. The main lead actor in this movie is so dashing that i couldn't resist myself to get obessed with him. He belongs to very well to do family though lives a life like a middle class family and is very helpful, kind and down to earth.</p>
